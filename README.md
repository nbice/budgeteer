Budgeting and expense tracking app

# Purpose

I have not met a budget app that I like. I will attempt to create a better version of a budgeting app that can categorize my transactions and track my spending. I will use the plaid API (I think it connects to my bank account) to pull all transactions since the last time I logged into the app. This is a personal project just for fun but I hope to build something that I can actually use for budgeting and financial planning.

## What makes a good budget/spending tracker?
A good budgeting app:
- Allows me to have custom spending categories/limits
- Includes categories for savings/investments and counting them differently, not just as an expense
- Can recognize transfers

## What makes a bad budget/spending tracker?
Bad budgeting apps:
- Do not categorize recurring transactions correctly
- Need to categorize every transaction even from vendors you have already categorized
- Front-load a budget deficit to the beginning of the month
    - ex: mortgage is paid on the first before you are paid and you have a negative balance in your budget# budgeteer
